# Task1
 My recommendations for improving database structure and aligning it with relation database best practices.
## Chaning Tables
    1. Split the bookings table into separate tables for users and parcs, with foreign key constraints linking them to the bookings table.
    2. This would involve creating a users table with columns for id, name, and email, and a parcs table with columns for id, name, and description.
    3. The bookings table would then reference the users and parcs tables using foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity.
## use of primary key
    'id' as the primary key of users, parcs, bookings
## Data Types.
    1. Use appropriate data types such as VARCHAR for variable-length character data, DATE for dates, etc.
    2. Define constraints such as NOT NULL to ensure that required fields cannot contain null values.
    3. Implement unique constraints where applicable to prevent duplicate data.
## Indexes
    Implement indexes on columns frequently used for querying to improve query performance. For example, indexing the id column in each table can enhance the speed of lookup operations.
## Foreign Key Constraints
    Utilize foreign key constraints to establish relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity. This ensures that references to data in one table are valid and consistent with data in related tables.
# Task2
    My latest project is building payment system of cryptocurrency. In this project, My role is frontend developer. Figma design is very Simple. But the client requires animation effect. So I use gsap module. This module is very fantastic. I just use only basic function but more deeper knowledge of this module would make a fantastic results.

    I am very excited in exploring IT world. Challenging difficult things , Learning new things and Communicating with clients is very suitable for me.
    Sometimes I feel I was born for this.

    Thank you.
